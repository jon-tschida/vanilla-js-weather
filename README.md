### Purpose for creating this project
I've made this project a handfull of different times in vanilla JS, this is the current iteration. 

I know that this is a popular project for aspiring developers to create, but I think it is for good reason. I learned a lot from this, and it gave me a lot of confidence to try to create other projects (such as the [Pokemon lookup](https://github.com/jon-tschida/Pokemon-Lookup) project)
